#+TITLE: contour - A Fortran program to trace isolines/contours in a 2D data map.

* Credit
This repository is intended for my personal exercise, study and
discovery. The code herein used was originally written  Paul D. Bourke.[fn:1]

* Introduction

 I'd call the algorithm 'marching squares' as it resembles the
 'marching cubes' for 3D data sets. Compute/find iso-lines/contours.
