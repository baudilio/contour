* Credit

This repository is intended for my personal exercise, study and
discovery. The code herein used was originally written by Paul
D. Bourke in F77.[fn:1]


* Introduction

 I would call the algorithm ~marching squares~ as it resembles the
 ~marching cubes~ for 3D data sets.[fn:2] Compute/find iso-lines/contours.
